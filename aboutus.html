            <h2>Abouts Us</h2>
            <p>Medhekar's Music Academy is the Platform for the people or Students who are interested in classical music and have seriousness in music. We will be starting this soon once the pandemic is over and everything will start normally.
                The idea of starting this platform had been since 2019, but due to some reasons it became delay to bring this idea into action.<br>
                Music is like we all can learn but the students must be interested and have that sprit to learn music.<br>
                Nothing is impossible in life we can do everything not a single thing is like that we cant do, just you should have interest and aim in life.<br><br>
                Music is the language of the spirit.It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.
                Music is the only language in which you cannot say a mean or sarcastic thing.
                Music is the art which is most nigh to tears and memory.It is your own experience,your thoughts,your wisdom.If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn.
